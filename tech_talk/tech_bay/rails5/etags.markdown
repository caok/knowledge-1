### Rails 5 switches from strong etags to weak etags

ETag, short for entity tag, is a part of HTTP header and is used for web cache validation. ETag is a digest of the resource that uniquely identifies specific version of the resource. This helps browser and web servers determine if resource in the browserâ€™s cache is exactly same as the resource on the server.
